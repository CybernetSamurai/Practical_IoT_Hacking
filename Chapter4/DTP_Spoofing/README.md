# VLAN Hopping: Switch Spoofing (2025.05)
Switch spoofing is a VLAN hopping technique that abuses Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), a Cisco proprietary protocol used to automatically negotiate trunk links between switches. In this attack, an adversary connects a device to an access port on a switch and configures their interface to actively participate in DTP negotiations. If the switch port is configured to negotiate (which is enabled by default), the attacker's device can spoof itself as a switch by sending forged DTP packets. This can trick the legitimate switch into establishing a trunk link, allowing the attacker to receive traffic from multiple VLANs, including those they shouldnâ€™t have access to. Once a trunk is established, the attacker can craft and analyze 802.1Q-tagged packets, making it possible to launch further attacks or passively eavesdrop on inter-VLAN traffic. This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling DTP on all client-facing switch ports.

> This lab was inspired by *Practical IoT Hacking* (O'Reilly), Chapter 4: **Network Assessments**, Section *"Hopping into the IoT Network"*. It assumes basic knowledge of GNS3 and networking.

## Initial Setup
### Switch Port Layout
| Switch  | Port  | Connected Device | VLAN    | Port Mode       |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| SWITCH1 | Et0/0 | SWITCH2          | N/A     | Trunk (Dynamic) |
| SWITCH1 | Et0/1 | ATTACKER         | VLAN 10 | Access          |
| SWITCH1 | Et0/2 | CAMERA_01        | VLAN 20 | Access          |
| SWITCH2 | Et0/0 | SWITCH1          | N/A     | Trunk (Dynamic) |
| SWITCH2 | Et0/1 | GUEST_LAPTOP     | VLAN 10 | Access          |
| SWITCH2 | Et0/2 | CAMERA_02        | VLAN 20 | Access          |

### VPCS Static IPv4 Configuration
To keep the lab simple, both **CAMERA_01**, **CAMERA_02**, and **GUEST_LAPTOP** are implemented using [VPCS](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/emulators/vpcs/) (Virtual PC Simulator) appliances. This provides a lightweight way to simulate basic IoT device connectivity within the network. The following commands assign an IP address and saves it across reboots.
<pre>
  VPCS> ip 192.168.0.x/24
  VPCS> save
</pre>

### Kali Static IPv4 Configuration
The **ATTACKER** machine is a Kali linux VM running the default [VirtualBox image](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines). This gives us access to most of the tools needed for these labs and will be reused in the future. Below shows the steps for configuring static IP addresses using CLI:
> Note: The shortcut for spawning a terminal in linux is `CTL+ALT+T`

Remove any existing configs
```
ip address flush dev eth0
```
Set static IPv4 address
```
ip address add 192.168.0.1/24 dev eth0
```
Verify
```
ip --color --family inet address show
```

### Cisco IOS
**SWITCH1** and **SWITCH2** are virtual Cisco IOS Layer 2 devices. You can use either the IOSvL2 or IOU L2 GNS3 appliance templates for this lab. They should work as standard switches 'out of the box', no configurations necessary. Note that since these are virtualized appliances, they may not behave exactly like their hardware counterparts.

## IOS VLAN Configuration
Create two new VLANs: one for the workstations (10) and another for the 'IoT' devices (20). I named them RED and BLUE respectivly to match the topology diagram.
<pre>
  SWITCH1> enable
  SWITCH1# configure terminal
  SWITCH1(config)# vlan 10
  SWITCH1(config-vlan)# name RED
  SWITCH1(config-vlan)# exit
  SWITCH1(config)# vlan 20
  SWITCH1(config-vlan)# name BLUE
  SWITCH1(config-vlan)# CTRL+Z
  SWITCH1# show vlan brief

  VLAN Name                             Status    Ports
  ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
  1    default                          active    Et0/0, Et0/1, Et0/2, Et0/3
                                                  Et1/0, Et1/1, Et1/2, Et1/3
                                                  Et2/0, Et2/1, Et2/2, Et2/3
                                                  Et3/0, Et3/1, Et3/2, Et3/3
  10   RED                              active
  20   BLUE                             active
</pre>

Assign RED to switchport Et0/1 (ATTACKER) and BLUE to Et0/2 (CAMERA_01).
<pre>
  SWITCH1# configure terminal
  SWITCH1(config)# interface Et0/1
  SWITCH1(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
  SWITCH1(config-if)# exit
  SWITCH1(config)# interface Et0/2
  SWITCH1(config-if)# switchport access vlan 20
  SWITCH1(config-if)# CTRL+Z
  SWITCH1# show vlan brief
  
  VLAN Name                             Status    Ports
  ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
  1    default                          active    Et0/0, Et0/3, Et1/0, Et1/1
                                                  Et1/2, Et1/3, Et2/0, Et2/1
                                                  Et2/2, Et2/3, Et3/0, Et3/1
                                                  Et3/2, Et3/3
  10   RED                              active    Et0/1
  20   BLUE                             active    Et0/2
</pre>

Repeat these step on SWITCH2 to assign GUEST_LAPTOP to VLAN 10 and CAMERA_02 to VLAN 20.

### DTP Configuration
Try to ping CAMERA_02 from CAMERA_02.

![Ping fail](assets/no-trunk-ping.gif)

By default, Cisco switches use DTP to negotiate trunk links. However, most switchports are set to `dynamic auto`, which means they will listen for DTP packets but will not initiate trunk formation. As a result, when both connected ports are in dynamic auto mode, no trunk is established. To enable trunking between SWITCH1 and SWITCH2, at least one side must be configured as `dynamic desirable`, which actively sends DTP packets and initiates the trunk negotiation.
<pre>
  SWITCH1# show interfaces Et0/0 switchport | include Name|Administrative Mode
  
  Name: Et0/0
  Administrative Mode: dynamic auto
</pre>

Configure SWITCH1 to negotiate a trunk link with SWITCH2.
<pre>
  SWITCH1(config)# interface Et0/0
  SWITCH1(config-if)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
  SWITCH1(config-if)# switchport mode dynamic desirable
  SWITCH1(config-if)# CTRL+Z
  SWITCH1# show interfaces Et0/0 switchport | include Name|Administrative Mode

  Name: Et0/0
  Administrative Mode: dynamic desirable
</pre>

Verify that Et0/0 is trunking our VLANs.
<pre>
  SWITCH1# show interfaces trunk
  
  Port        Mode             Encapsulation  Status        Native vlan
  Et0/0       desirable        802.1q         trunking      1

  Port        Vlans allowed on trunk
  Et0/0       1-4094

  Port        Vlans allowed and active in management domain
  Et0/0       1,10,20

  Port        Vlans in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned
  Et0/0       1,10,20
</pre>

## Verify Subnet Segmentation
If configured correctly, CAMERA_01 can now ping CAMERA_02...

![Verify BLUE Ping](assets/camera1-ping-camera2.gif)

ATTACKER can ping GUEST_LAPTOP...

![Verify RED Ping](assets/attacker-ping-guest.gif)

But ATTACKER cannot ping either camera...

## Exploit
### Yersinia
[Yersinia](https://github.com/tomac/yersinia) is a framework for performing layer 2 attacks. It supports multiple protocols including STP, CDP, DHCP, HSRP, VTP, ISL, and 802.1x. However, we will be taking a closer look at its DTP forging and 802.1q sniffing capabilities. This tool can be downloaded with the following command, although it should be installed by default on Kali:
```
apt -y install yersinia
```

In SWITCH1, lets verify the current status of our interfaces.
<pre>
  SWITCH1# show interfaces status
  
  Port      Name               Status       Vlan       Duplex  Speed Type
  Et0/0                        connected    trunk        auto   auto unknown
  Et0/1                        connected    10           auto   auto unknown
  Et0/2                        connected    20           auto   auto unknown
</pre>
As expected, we currently have two access ports and one trunk port.

Spawn a new terminal session in ATTACKER and start Yersinia in `Interactive mode`.
```
yersinia -I
```
> By default, `eth0` will likely be selected as the default interface. If this is not correct, press `I` to bring up a list of interfaces, and toggle the correct one.

The default interface is set to `STP mode`. Press `G` to bring up a list of protocols, navigate to `DTP` and press `ENTER`. To start a switch spoofing attack, press `X` and select `1`. You should quickly start to see DTP packets being caputerd negotation a trunk connection.

![DTP attack](assets/yersinia-dtp-attack.gif)

In SWITCH1, we should see that Et0/1 is now a second trunk port.
<pre>
  SWITCH1# show interfaces status
  
  Port      Name               Status       Vlan       Duplex  Speed Type
  Et0/0                        connected    trunk        auto   auto unknown
  Et0/1                        connected    trunk        auto   auto unknown
  Et0/2                        connected    20           auto   auto unknown
</pre>

While Yersinia is running, press `G` again and naviagate to `802.1q`. Now that we are a "trunk" accepting all VLANs, we should start seeing tagged broadcast traffic from each VLAN. This will help us identify which VLANs are on the network which we can later hop into. Alternatively, you can open Wireshark, filter for `vlan.id` and see this same trafic as shown below:

### Creating VLAN Interfaces in Linux
<pre>
  apt install vlan
  modprobe 8021q
  lsmod | grep 8021q
  ip link add link eth0 name eth0.10 type vlan id 10
  ip link add link eth0 name eth0.20 type vlan id 20
  ip address add 192.168.0.1/24 dev eth0.10
  ip address add 192.168.0.1/24 dev eth0.20
  ip link set dev eth0.10 up
  ip link set dev eth0.20 up
</pre>
